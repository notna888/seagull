# Seagull Page Generation Script

I don't honestly expect anyone to use this, it's mostly just for me.

I'll add more description of it later


Some features though in case I forget.
* Compiles scss.
* Minifies JS and CSS.
* Uses jinja2 for html templating.
* Uses Jquery, Bootstrap, Popper.js.
* Has ajax navigation that I've written.


There's lots of improvements I've got to make to it, but for now it's okay to share I think.

Named Seagull as a homage to Pelican, which is what inspired me to make this.
